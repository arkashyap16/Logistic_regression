# 🧠 Logistic Regression - Binary Classification

This project is part of the AI & ML Internship and focuses on solving a **binary classification** problem using **Logistic Regression**. The model is trained and evaluated on the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset**.

---

## 📌 Objective

- Build a binary classifier using Logistic Regression
- Evaluate it using standard metrics like confusion matrix, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC
- Understand sigmoid function and threshold tuning

---

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn (sklearn)

---

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: `sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer()`
- **Description**: Features computed from digitized images of breast mass. The task is to classify tumors as **malignant (0)** or **benign (1)**.

---

## 🧪 Steps Performed

1. **Loaded** the Breast Cancer dataset
2. **Split** into training and testing sets
3. **Standardized** features using `StandardScaler`
4. **Trained** a Logistic Regression model using `LogisticRegression()`
5. **Predicted** probabilities and labels on test data
6. **Evaluated** model using:
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Classification Report
   - Precision & Recall
   - ROC-AUC Score
   - ROC Curve
7. **Tuned threshold** for better control over precision-recall trade-off

---

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

- **Accuracy**
- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **F1 Score**
- **ROC-AUC Curve**

---

## 🔍 Key Concepts Learned

- Difference between Logistic vs Linear Regression
- Understanding the **Sigmoid Function**
- Threshold tuning and its impact on prediction
- Importance of **Confusion Matrix** in classification
- **ROC Curve** and **AUC** as performance indicators
